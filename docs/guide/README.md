# Introduction

V-Craft (inspired by [Craft.js](https://craft.js.org/)) is a toolset for building extensible page builders with Vue.js. Instead of a complete page builder with a user interface and designed element blocks out of the box, V-Craft only provides the essentials of the page builder. With V-Craft, you will be able to focus on the specifications and use cases of your page builder project, and build your page builder perfectly fit on your needs.

## Features

 - Easily wrap your Vue.js components into page elements
 - Build-in drag-n-drop system
 - Control how page elements are edited yourself
 - Manipulatable and serializable editor state
